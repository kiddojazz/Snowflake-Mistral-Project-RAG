"""
    CHAT_MARKDOWN = """

### **How to Use This Page**

1. **Send a Prompt**:
   - Use the **chat input box** at the bottom of the page to send your query.
   - If your query is related to the database table, a **dataframe** will be generated based on the backend database.

2. **Handle Non-Table Responses**:
   - If your query is **not related** to the database table, the response will be plain text.
   - Kindly focus on **database-related queries** to generate a dataframe.

3. **Activate AI Chat in Sidebar**:
   - Once a dataframe has been generated, you can enable the **AI Chat** for further analysis or discussions.
   - Toggle the **"Activate Sidebar"** option in the sidebar to chat with the AI, which uses the dataframe as context.

4. **Explore More**:
   - After you're done, you can return to the chat input and send a new prompt to explore additional information from the table.

---

### **Notes**
- Ensure your queries are **database-focused** for accurate dataframe generation.
- Use the **AI Chat** to gain deeper insights based on the generated dataframe.
- Repeat the process to explore different aspects of the database.

Enjoy your interactive data exploration experience!
